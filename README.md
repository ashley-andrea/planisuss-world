# Planisuss World Simulation
The main goal of this project was to leverage libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib to develop a fictitious ecosystem and extract data from it, in order to study the complex interactions driving its inhabitants' lives.
## Requirements

The project was developed in VSCode, so its working is assured in that environment. However, one might need to install all the needed libraries. Those are essentially NumPy, Matplotlib and Tkinter, which I exploited for the GUI part.

Also, note that the graphic representation employs images to render a zoomed version of creatures and background material. I designed the images and implemented them in the simulation. To be able to run the simulation correctly and visualize the images, it is important to open the whole 'AshleyAndrea_Squarcio_512909' folder in your environment of choice, and not only the 'planisuss_world.py' file.
